# Make Track Hub for Genome Browser
## After creating a BED file with PoGo, make a bigBED .bb file
Make a repository with bigBED files to link to UCSC Genome Browser <br />
This will create two files: hub.txt and genome.txt <br />
It will also create a file of .bb files. These can be linked to Genome Browser via the "Raw" link
