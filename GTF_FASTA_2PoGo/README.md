The scripts are adapted from Gloria Sheynkman's GitHub repository found here: https://github.com/sheynkman-lab/Gloria-Sheynkman/tree/main/Convert_PacBio_Protein_GTF_FASTA_to_Pogo_Compatible <br />

The FASTA file should be a refined.FASTA file from the ORF-Calling module of the LRP Pipeline, which can be found here: https://github.com/sheynkman-lab/Long-Read-Proteogenomics/tree/main/modules/orf_calling <br />
