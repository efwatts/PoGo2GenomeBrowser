# Convert data frame with peptide information to PoGo-friendly format
This module will take a data frame with the peptide-specific sequences in one column and change it to a data frame ready for input to PoGo as `-in pogo` <br />
The `.csv` files in this repository contain information about peptides. They need to be converted to `.txt` files that are compatible with PoGo via the R script `ProteinDF2PoGo.R`
